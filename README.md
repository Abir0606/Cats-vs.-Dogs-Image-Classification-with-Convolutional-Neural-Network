# Cats-vs.-Dogs-Image-Classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Network
This repository contains a Python script for building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on the Dogs vs. Cats dataset and can predict whether an input image is a cat or a dog.
